Hi all, if you already know this site this is probably for the Ultima Online Stygian Abyss loader i made (or the Reader).

Well, in the last few years i spent some of my spare time on UO because i think it's one of the best games i ever played.

Today (17-06-2013) i decided to go "open" and release all the knowledge i have about the Enhanced Client. (that is a lot, i think :) )

Why? Because i hope there will be out there some people who will use those information trying to make UO a better game.

EA released the Enhanced client in 2009 and right now the only improvement announced is the "high resolution", that has been always postponed. High res is important, but that is not the only thing EC is missing. Wanna talk about UI(thank god Pinco helped..), stability, shaders?

Anyway,

what you will find in this wiki:

  * **Screenshots**: about a custom (well made) map rendered on the Enhanced Client.
  * **Screenshots**: about what you can do with the information given by the formats.
  * **Formats**: How to load almost every type of file included in the Ultima Online's Mythic packages.
  * **Programs**: Description of the programs i made over time that were already here before this wiki.
