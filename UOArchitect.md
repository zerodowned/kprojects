# UO:Architect v2.6.8 mod-K #

UO:Architect was a populare program used by UO builders.
It was not enough for mine builders, so made some improvements (see the changelog).

I'm sorry but i will not provide support for this program.

Notice: this program was released before HS expansion, so it's missing all the HS items.
Notice2: to use this program with EC you need both EC and CC.

**Download in the download section.**
